  "prompt": "A young girl sits on a weathered wooden bench, gazing wistfully out to sea, as vibrant autumn leaves swirl and settle around her feet in a soft, golden light. The sky above is a warm, sunny yellow, with a few wispy clouds scattered across it. In the distance, the waves gently lap against the shore, creating a soothing melody that fills the air. The girl's slender figure, dressed in a cozy sweater and jeans, seems small yet content amidst the vast expanse of nature. To her left, a fallen branch from a nearby tree lies on the ground, partially obscuring her view of the sea. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and serene, evoking feelings of nostalgia and tranquility.",
