  "prompt": "A serene, comic book-inspired illustration of a cat snuggled up in bed, fast asleep, with its head resting on the edge of a plush pillow. The feline should be depicted in a cozy pose, with one paw tucked under its body and the other stretched out beside it. Soft, warm lighting should fill the scene, casting gentle shadows on the bedroom walls. The color palette should be vibrant and playful, with bold lines and exaggerated features characteristic of comic book art. Incorporate a subtle texture to convey the comfort of the bed and the softness of the pillow. Consider using a 16:9 aspect ratio for this image, maintaining a balanced composition that fills the frame without overwhelming it.",
