  "prompt": "An anime-style illustration of a young man sitting alone on a wooden bench, gazing longingly at the majestic Maiden's Tower amidst a serene and snowy Istanbul landscape. The tower's intricate stone carvings and delicate minaret should be visible from afar. Soft, warm lighting should illuminate the scene, casting a mystical glow over the snow-covered cityscape. The man's coat should be partially open, revealing a hint of his winter attire beneath. In the background, subtle hints of the Bosphorus Strait and Hagia Sophia's silhouette should be discernible through the misty atmosphere. The overall mood should evoke a sense of melancholic wonder, as if time has stood still for this solitary figure lost in thought.",
